Vehicle Detection System using YOLOv4

Description:
The Vehicle Detection System using YOLOv4 is an intelligent traffic monitoring project designed to detect and classify vehicles in real-time. Using the powerful YOLOv4 (You Only Look Once, version 4) algorithm, this system can identify different types of vehicles such as cars, buses, bikes, cycles, and more.

Key Features:

  * Real-time vehicle detection using YOLOv4

  * Counts the number of vehicles in a traffic scene

  * Classifies vehicles into types (car, bus, bike, cycle, etc.)

  * Efficient and fast detection suitable for traffic monitoring systems

Technologies Used:

Python

YOLOv4 for object detection

OpenCV for image/video processing

Use Case:
This system is ideal for traffic monitoring, smart city projects, and automated vehicle analysis, providing both visual detection and quantitative insights into traffic patterns.
